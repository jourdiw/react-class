/**
 * create-react-app default webpack configuration handles css files in two ways:
 *  - importing "<filepath>.css" will add it's content to the global css file, whithout any tranformation
 *  - importing "<filepath>.module.css" will handle it as a 'css module':
 *    (https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/adding-a-css-modules-stylesheet)
 *    Class names are returned as an object from the import, to be used as object keys in className attributes.
 *    They will be renamed on build time in order to have unique names, avoiding potentialname clashes,
 *    and allowing you to name your css classes without worring if they havae already been used elsewhere.
 *
 *  Css files path resolution follow the standard import rules
 *  (relative to current location if starting with . or .. , in node_modules elseway)
